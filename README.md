# Simple Pathfinding

This simple program is my attempt at implementing A* search algorithm to a simplified version of RimWorld as a proof of concept.

This is developed using PyGame so please install PyGame before running the program.

You can do this by:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

I added --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.
